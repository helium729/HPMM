# High-Performance Modular Multiplier for PQC (Kyber & Falcon) on FPGA

## Overview

This repository provides an ultra-low-area hardware implementation of modular reduction and multiplication for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) schemes.

Based on the novel **LUT-K reduction** technique proposed by *Bertels et al. (2024)* in "A Better Kyber Butterfly for FPGAs", this project achieves the smallest reported area for the Kyber modular multiplier. Furthermore, we bridge the gap between academic theory and engineering by:

1.  **Completing the Architecture**: Extending the original butterfly-only design into a full modular multiplier Processing Element (PE), integrated into the architecture of *Yaman et al.*.
2.  **Algorithm Portability**: Successfully porting the LUT-K reduction technique to the **Falcon** signature scheme, demonstrating the method's versatility.

## Key Features

- **Minimal Area (Kyber)**: Achieves **49 LUTs** and **1 DSP** for the modular multiplier, utilizing the hybrid K-reduction and LUT-based reduction strategy.
- **High Performance (Falcon)**: Optimized LUT-K reduction for Falcon achieves **291 MHz** on Artix-7.
- **Robust Verification**: Includes comprehensive testbenches covering all possible twiddle factors and input ranges to ensure 100% computational accuracy.

## Performance & Resource Utilization

The designs were implemented and synthesized using **Vivado 2024.2** on a Xilinx **Artix-7 FPGA** (`xc7a200tffg1156-3`).

## Functional Description

This project provides two independent hardware IP cores and one reduction primitive:

### 1. Kyber Modular Multiplier (High-Performance — 4-PE)

`src/high-performance-multiplier/` implements a **4 Processing Element** polynomial multiplier for the Kyber (ML-KEM) scheme. Each PE handles one 12-bit coefficient pair per cycle, giving a throughput of 4 coefficients/cycle. It supports three hardware-controlled operations triggered by a single-cycle strobe signal:

| Operation | Signal | Description |
|:----------|:-------|:------------|
| Forward NTT | `start_fntt` | Transforms coefficients into the NTT domain |
| Pointwise Mul | `start_pwm2` | Coefficient-wise multiplication in NTT domain |
| Inverse NTT | `start_intt` | Transforms back and outputs final product |

A full polynomial multiplication (256-point NTT × NTT → PWM → INTT) completes automatically; the `done` signal pulses for one cycle upon completion.

### 2. Kyber Modular Multiplier (Lightweight — 1-PE)

`src/lightweight-multiplier/` is the area-minimal variant using a **single PE**. It exposes the same interface as the 4-PE version (drop-in compatible signals), but processes one coefficient pair per cycle at lower throughput. This is the design that achieves **49 LUTs + 1 DSP** at 331 MHz.

### 3. Falcon LUT-K Reduction Unit

`src/reduction-falcon/` provides:
- **`falcon_KRED`**: A 2-stage pipelined modular multiplier for $q = 12289$ using the LUT-K technique. Computes $(-3 \cdot a \cdot b) \bmod q$; the implicit $-3$ factor is absorbed into pre-computed twiddle factors ($W' = W \cdot (-3)^{-1} \bmod q$, where $(-3)^{-1} \bmod 12289 = 4096$).
- **`butterfly_falcon_kred`**: A complete CT/GS butterfly unit integrating `falcon_KRED` for full NTT on 1024-coefficient Falcon polynomials.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|:-----|:--------|:------|
| Xilinx Vivado | 2024.2 (recommended) | Synthesis, implementation & simulation |
| Target FPGA | Artix-7 `xc7a200tffg1156-3` | Or compatible Artix-7 device |

> Vivado can be downloaded from [AMD/Xilinx Download Center](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html). A free WebPACK license is sufficient for Artix-7 synthesis.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kyrie-T/HPMM.git
cd HPMM
```

### Add Sources to Vivado

1. Launch Vivado and create a new **RTL Project**.
2. In the *Add Sources* dialog, add all `.v` files from the desired `src/` sub-directory.
3. Set the top-level module:
   - For 4-PE Kyber: `KyberHPM4PE_top`
   - For 1-PE Kyber: `KyberHPM1PE_top`
   - For Falcon reduction only: `falcon_KRED` or `butterfly_falcon_kred`
4. Set the target part to `xc7a200tffg1156-3` (or your device).

## Usage

### Running Testbenches (Simulation)

All testbenches in `tb/` are self-checking and print `PASS` / `FAIL` to the console. Reference data is loaded from `test-data/` via `$readmemh`.

**In Vivado Simulator:**

1. Add the chosen testbench `.v` from `tb/` as a simulation source.
2. Add the corresponding `src/` RTL files.
3. Run behavioral simulation (`Run Simulation → Run Behavioral Simulation`).
4. Observe the console output for test results.

## Technical Details

### The LUT-K Reduction Technique

Modular reduction is often the bottleneck in Lattice-based cryptography. This project leverages the specific structure of PQC moduli ($q = k \cdot 2^x + 1$) to perform efficient reduction:

1. **LUT-based Reduction**: Uses FPGA primitives (LUT-6) to pre-calculate reduction for high-order bits.
2. **K-Reduction**: Exploits the property $k \cdot 2^x \equiv -1 \pmod q$ to strictly bound the result.

### Adaptation for Falcon

We extended the technique to the Falcon algorithm by adapting the parameters to its specific modulus:

- **Modulus**: $q = 12289$
- **Decomposition**: $12289 = 3 \cdot 2^{12} + 1$
- **Optimization**: The design efficiently handles the larger bit-width required for Falcon while maintaining a high clock frequency (291 MHz).

## Requirements

- **FPGA**: Xilinx Artix-7 (tested on `xc7a200tffg1156-3`)
- **Toolchain**: Xilinx Vivado 2024.2
- **Language**: Verilog HDL
